# layoutlmv2-practice
Fine-tuning the layoutlmv2 model with the CORD and FUNSD datasets.

Code based on https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/LayoutLMv2.

Modifications include (1) combining both datasets and (2) undersampling the FUNSD dataset so that the CORD and FUNSD datasets have similar numbers of labels.
